    <h1>BORN A CRIME</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1 & 2 review</h2>
    <img src="images/trevor.jpg">
    <p>Black South Africans were split up into tribes in the pre-apartheid era, which Noah introduces us to in the book.
        The ancient wars between the Zulu and Xhosa tribes provide a backdrop for the ongoing racial tensions in the book 
         and when we look at the situation in machakos people fight among themselves and also extend the war between different tribes in the county.</p><br>
       <p> Being a devoted Christian, Trevor's mother manages the complexities of going to multiple churches that serve diverse racial groups.
        The difficulties families had traveling to these chapels, which were frequently reached by convoluted transportation, are brought to light by the logistics of the journey.</p><br>
         <p> Although apartheid did not exist in Machakos County,but Families also struggled with issues of transportation and cultural diversity.
          The diverse racial groups in churches are not really there , but some of the churches are divided economically.
        Despite the absence of apartheid, the county has a history of fighting against racial discrimination and colonization. 
        Similar difficulties were faced by mixed-race families, and the struggle for equality is still today in workplaces and in churches.
